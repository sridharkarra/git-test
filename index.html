    <h3>How many time zones are there</h3>
    <p>Given a 24-hour day and 360 degrees of longitude around the Earth,
        it is obvious that the world's standard time zones have to be 15 degrees wide, on average.
        Some sources claim there are 24 standard time zones, while others say there are 25 time zones.
